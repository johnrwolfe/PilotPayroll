	'This is an incomplete rendering of an ERP component representing basic payroll management.
For current demonstration purposes, only some basic functionality is implemented.

An employee''s total compensation may be composed of a number of payment types.
This is represented by a set of ''payment structure'' entities which carry a nominal value.
Some payment types represent multipliers which apply to other types - e.g. bonus as percentage of salary.

When payroll is generated for a pay period, a corresponding set of editable values is created.
These values may be viewed, held, approved; at present, there is no support for editing values.

Note:
There is no support for accepting changes to a department''s staff.
There is no support for modifying the structure of an employee''s compensation.
There are some placeholder actions where interaction with a Finance component would occur.
